### Linked Lists - Challenge #2
- Use the starter project in the resources section
- Implement a method in the IntegerLinkedList class that inserts a value in sorted order
- Lower values should appear first in the list (be closer to the head) 
- If we insert 4,2,1,5, list should look like HEAD->1->2->4->5->null
- IntegerLinkedList is a singly-linked list
- Project contains all the code you need and an empty insertSorted() method
- Main method contains code that should work when you're finished
